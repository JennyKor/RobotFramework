# RobotFramework

<p>Some old test case excercises done on Robot Framework. Some of these use images and text files located in my computer's directory so I wasn't entirely sure how to proceed with them, so I left them out.</p>
<p>Blazedemo: Testing the blazedemo.com test website, giving inputs and seeing if they match (a lot of them don't). This one complained about .ipynb-file, so we're going with the .robot.</p>
<p>ImageComparing: Comparing existing title header in the computer's directory with the one found on the website. Uses Selenium library.</p>
<p>Ping: Getting different website addresses from a text file, pinging them, doing a lot of manual parsing to get the times, and finally doing some comparing. </p>
<p>Vaalikone: A group excercise where we had the task to test Yle's Election Machine. Again getting familiar with Selenium.</p>
